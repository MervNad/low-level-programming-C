# Low-Level Programming in C

Welcome to my repository, Low-Level Programming in C! This repository is a comprehensive collection of everything I am learning about C programming. My name is Merveilles Biende Katumba, and I am the owner of this repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

### Chapters

Each chapter I cover from the book "The C Programming Language" by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan will have its own folder. These folders will include:

- Chapter Notes: Summaries and important concepts from the chapter.
- Exercises: Solutions to the exercises at the end of each chapter.

### Projects

This folder contains various projects that I build to apply what I have learned. Each project will have its own sub-folder with the following:

- Source Code: The .c files for the project.
- README: A brief description of the project, its purpose, and how to run it.
- Resources: Any additional resources or references used in the project.

## Primary Learning Source

The primary source of learning for this repository is the book "The C Programming Language" by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan. This book is widely regarded as the definitive guide to C programming and will serve as the foundation for my learning journey.

## Additional Resources

In addition to the book, I will use various other resources to supplement my learning and for the projects. These may include online tutorials, documentation, forums, and other programming books. All additional resources will be cited in the respective project folders.

## Updates

I will regularly update this repository with new chapters, exercises, and projects as I progress. The README will also be updated to reflect any new additions or changes.
